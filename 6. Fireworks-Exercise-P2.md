# Fireworks Challange Part 2

SignalR based application that allows website users to light fireworks and display on all the connected site users. You can light single or multishot using the app.

There is also a button that can stimulate a crash. Pressing the button again will make the application run again.

The application can only run as a single instance and does not support scaleout at present.

## Port Exposed
* 80

## Images: 

* Green: kunalbabre/fireworks:green
* Blue: kunalbabre/fireworks:blue
* Red: kunalbabre/fireworks:red

* Latest: kunalbabre/fireworks:latest (is green)

## Trigger fireworks manually 

* Trigger Single - ```/home/singleshot```
* Trigger Multishot - ```/home/multishot```

## Health Monitoring 

* Liveness - ```/home/isRunning```
    * returns HTTP 200 if the application is alive
    * returns HTTP 400 if the application has crashed

* Readiness  - ```/home/isRunning``` 
    * returns HTTP 200 if the application is alive
    * returns HTTP 400 if the application has crashed



# Exercise Part 2

1. Scale App to 1 instance 
2. Simulate shooting of 100's of multishot at once, take advantage of parallel and completions properties (Create Job)
```bash
# Tip 1: There is a URL to trigger multishot
# Tip 2: Create a CronJob running multiple pods in parallel 
# Tip 3: Spec of your container in pod might look something like
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - for i in {1..5};do wget fireservice:80/home/multiShot; sleep 1;done
        image: busybox
```
3. Create the CronJob to run the simulation every 1 minute
